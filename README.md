# StakePool Operator Scripts (SPOS)

Useful scripts from **ATADA_StakePool_Austria** for any StakePool Operator out there ...<br>&nbsp;<br>

## About <img src="https://www.stakepool.at/pics/stakepool_operator_scripts.png" align="right" border=0>

Theses scripts here should help you to manage your StakePool via the CLI. You can work in **online- and/or offline-mode**, you can use and migrate to **Hardware-Wallets**, you can send **transactions with messages**, you can do the **Catalyst registration**, you can **mint/burn Tokens**, you can generate the files for the **Token-Registry** and _much much more_. :smiley:

Scripts were made to make things easier while learning all the commands and steps to bring up the stakepool node.
